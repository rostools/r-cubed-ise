This course is designed to address these issues in code-along sessions
(instructor and learner coding together), reading activities, and
exercises using real-world datasets. This website contains all of the
material for the course, from reading material to exercises to images.
It is structured as a book, with "chapters" as lessons, given in order
of appearance. We make heavy use of the website throughout the course
where code-along sessions follow the material on the website nearly
exactly (with slight modifications for time or more detailed
explanations).

The course material was created using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) to
write the lessons and create the book format,
[GitHub](https://github.com/) to host the [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
repository of the material, and [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) with
[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) to create and host the website. The
original source material for this course is found on the
[`r-cubed-ise`](https://github.com/rostools/r-cubed-ise) GitHub
repository.
