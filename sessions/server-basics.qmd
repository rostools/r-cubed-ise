<!-- TODO: Add an introduction here -->

**Session objectives**:

Introduction presentation, overview.

General server environment types, what does it look like, why use it,
how to identify strengths/weaknesses, within RStudio in the server.

Filesystem? Coding? Basic server etiquette?

Where to save things (some servers delete everything after logout, where
are things saved?)

Small differences with using Git? (e.g. cheatsheet/steps to take when
starting up and using a server for the first time)
