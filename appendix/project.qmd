# Group project assignment {#sec-assignment}

To maximize how much you learn and how much you will retain, you as a
group will take what you learn in the course and apply it to create a
reproducible project. This project ...

During the last session of the course you will work on this assignment.
In the last \~20 minutes of this session, the lead instructor will ...
and re-generate your report to check that it is reproducible.

## Specific tasks

You will be collaborating as a team using ... to manage your group
assignment. We will set up the project with ... for you so you can
quickly start collaborating together on the project.

Your specific tasks are:

Sequence of steps for project:

-   Starting point:
    -   Learning how to identify what file storage format (e.g. csv or
        SAS dataset) there are and knowing how convert those files into
        more efficient formats (like Parquet or a SQL database)
    -   Give them a few server environment types, and the same data but
        with different starting formats. And then they figure out the
        next steps based on that information
    -   Multiple data is big enough to prevent doing it normal way (1 Gb
        or larger?)
-   Explaining why the original data format might not be ideal and then
    converting the data into more efficient format
-   Identify what the desired sample is for the dataset, only select and
    filter data they need for analysis
-   Split the data into smaller chunk to prototype code (running code on
    all the data later)
-   Run basic analysis (descriptive statistics)... Not modeling
-   Implement some code to run with parallel processing
-   Identifying which format data or items can be downloaded, and
    converting that to that format

Assumptions:

-   Assume they have taken the intermediate course (need to know
    functionals and function-based workflows), and either have read or
    taken the advanced course or are familiar enough with targets

## Quick "checklist" for a good project

## Expectations for the project

What we expect you to do for the group project:

What we don't expect:

Essentially, the group project is a way to reinforce what you learned
during the course, but in a more relaxed and collaborative setting.
